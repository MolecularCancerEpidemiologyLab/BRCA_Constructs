# BRCA_Constructs

This repository contains all bash scripts and files used to predict the types of splicing aberration generated by the *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* variants assayed using the SeqSplice method. We used the SpliceAI-10k calculator with modified algorithm incorporating the SpliceAI alternate scores (https://github.com/adavi4/SAI-10k-calc). We used the GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fa from NCBI as reference for the SpliceAI run.
